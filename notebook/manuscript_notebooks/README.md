Within this directory contains the code used to generate the visualizations in the manuscript. 

We do not include the notebooks used to generate, as they require latitude and longitude data:
-  Figure S5, S6, S7
-  Figure 1, 5

Note: some filepaths and names might have to be changed to replicate results

The notebooks are as follows. 

- fig_D_L.ipynb: generates Figure 6,7, and S8
- fig_inc_comp.ipynb: generates Figure 3
- fig_SM_eps.ipynb: generates Figure S3
- fig_SM_gridsearch.ipynb: generates Figures S1,S2
- fig_SM_post.ipynb: generates Figure S4
- fig_best_config.ipynb: generates Figures 4
- net_stats.ipynb: generates statistics used in Table I
