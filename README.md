## Modeling Plant Disease Epidemics in Networks ## 

### Overview ###
----------
This research project uses data from the biosecurity compnay OnSide to create mobility networks of the horticulture industry in New Zealand. The spreading of a plant-disease is represented using a metapopulaton model, where we link different properties if people move between them. To describe the average dynamical behaivor of the system, a mean-field approximation is used.
